/**
 * S-23: what the tightened Content-Security-Policy would have blocked.
 *
 * While the tightened policy runs report-only (contentSecurityPolicy.ts, `cspRollout`), browsers
 * post a report for every resource it would have refused. They are kept here — in memory, grouped
 * and capped — and never written to the database:
 *
 * - the endpoint is unauthenticated by nature (a browser cannot sign a violation report), so a
 *   row per report would be a free write amplifier for anyone with curl;
 * - a report is operational evidence for one deployment, not a workspace record, so it has no
 *   workspace to belong to and no row-level security rule that would fit it;
 * - what the decision to enforce actually needs is "which directive, which origin, how often",
 *   which is a counter, not a log.
 *
 * `GET /api/csp-report/summary` (platform admin) reads the groups back.
