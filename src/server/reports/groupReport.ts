/**
 * The group summary (Z-20, first step of the multi-entity design Z-16): for one of the person's
 * groups of books (DA-01) and a period, each member's profit and loss and balance sheet side by side,
 * and the group's total when all members keep their books in the same currency. Each member is read
 * under the person's own access, never copied into another ledger; members the person can no longer
 * open are not included, and the answer says how many. Every figure is the member's own report, so it
 * can be opened in its own books.
 *
 * Translation (Z-17, Z-18): with a reporting currency, each member in another currency is translated
 * with the rates given for it (1 unit of its currency in the reporting currency): the closing rate
 * at the end date for assets and liabilities, the period's average rate for its income and costs,
 * and the historical rate for its equity and the profit of earlier periods. The difference that
 * leaves is the translation difference (CTA), shown on its own line so the group still balances.
 * Rates are never invented: a missing one is refused.
 *
 * Dealings between the companies (Z-19): an entry posted as intercompany (`metadata.isIntercompany`,
 * with the other company and its entry) needs its match there. Matched pairs are counted; the rest
 * are listed with why: the match is missing, was undone, or has another amount, or the other company
 * is outside the group (or not one the person can open).
 *
 * Eliminations (CB-26, Z-16 step 5): what the companies owe each other (balances on their
 * intercompany accounts: role 'intercompany', or "Intercompany" in the name) is taken out of the
 * group's total assets and liabilities. If the two sides differ, the difference is said, and kept in
 * equity so the total still balances. Their sales to each other in the period (the income and the
 * costs of intercompany entries in force between members) are taken out of the total income, cost of
 * goods sold and expenses; net income stays the companies' own, so if the two sides disagree, the
 * difference is said and stays in it.
 *
 * Parent and ownership (Z-16): when the group names its parent company, every other member is one the
 * parent controls (owned above 50%), so its books are added in full and the part that belongs to its
 * other owners (non-controlling interest) is said: their share of its equity and of its profit. A
 * group with a parent is a consolidation, so it is refused while any of its companies is not one the
 * person can open, never quietly short. The parent's investment in each company (the balance of the
 * account named for it in the parent's books) is taken out of the total assets and equity. When the day
 * the parent bought the company is given, what it paid above its share of the company's book value
 * (the company's equity at the end of that day) is goodwill: it stays in the total assets and equity
 * and is said. Paid below the book value is said too, and nothing is added. An account holding several
 * companies has goodwill only when the day each was bought is given.
