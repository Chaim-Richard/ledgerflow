/**
 * L-123 step 2 (docs/design/L-123-server-balances.md): the server reports read their opening from
 * `balancesAsOf` (a year-end snapshot plus the entries after it) instead of every entry since the books began.
 *
 * A report at D reads the balances through the day before D, then the entries dated D (or the period) with the
 * same query as before. The split is at the day before, not at D, so an entry stored with a clock time on day D
 * is treated as it always was by the report's own date query (left out of a report ending on D); every figure is
 * the same to the byte.
 *
 * The opening is not used (null: the caller reads every entry, as before) when the report needs more than the
 * snapshot holds:
 * - `gross`: the debits and credits per account (the trial balance), or the lines per account, which tell lines
 *   on accounts outside the chart (the balance sheet lists them one by one as orphaned lines);
 * - a snapshot built before step 2 has neither, until it is rebuilt.
