 *
 * - `POST /api/csp-report` — the browser's own report. No sign-in (a browser cannot authenticate a
 *   report) and no CSRF token (it is sent by the user agent, not by the app), so it is registered
 *   before those layers in server.ts and given its own limit, its own 16 kB body limit and its own
 *   content types. It only increments counters held in memory (cspViolations.ts).
 * - `GET /api/csp-report/summary` — platform admins read the groups back and decide whether the
 *   policy is safe to enforce (`CSP_TIGHTEN=enforce`).
 * - `DELETE /api/csp-report/summary` — start counting again after a fix.
