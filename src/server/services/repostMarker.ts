/**
 * EG-1 step 1 (docs/design/EG-1-repost-engine.md): the repost queue. The dirty mark itself is made by the database,
 * in the same transaction as the stock move (trigger lf_repost_mark on stockMoves,
 * supabase/migrations/20261023010000_repost_queue.sql), so every path that writes stock moves marks it: postings
 * through commitLedgerBulk, stock adjustments, manual cost of goods, revaluations. A move dated before a move
 * already in the item's history marks the item's `stock-cost` row from that date; nothing is marked in the common
 * case, a move with no later ones.
 *
 * Until the migration is applied, the run answers that it is not set up: `repostQueueReady` looks for the table,
 * as stockMovesReady does.
