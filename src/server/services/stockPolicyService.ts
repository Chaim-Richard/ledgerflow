/**
 * Selling below zero (W-06): by default an invoice that sells more than is on hand is recorded,
 * stock goes below zero and a warning says so (simple books are never blocked). An owner can turn on
 * "Refuse sales beyond stock": then the server refuses any sale that would take an item below zero
 * (cogsStockService.ts), and nothing of it is written. Only the server writes the setting
 * (`refuseNegativeStock` on the workspace), only for owners, with an audit line. Stock adjustments
 * never go below zero and the manual cost-of-goods-sold entry always refuses it, whatever the setting.
