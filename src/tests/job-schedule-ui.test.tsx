/**
 * Settings → Schedule (BB-06), the tab itself: it asks once, shows what the last run did job by job,
 * says when the next one is due, and reads like the sentences the rules produce rather than like a
 * status code. The payload is built by `describeSchedule` itself, so what the screen shows is what the
 * rules say — a screen that quietly re-worded them would fail here.
